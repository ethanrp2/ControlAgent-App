Let's denote this pole as p.\n[Step2] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L greater than (5*p) for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Systems with unstable pole(s) puts a hard limit on the achievable bandwidth, you should never choose a loop bandwidth less than (5*p).\nWithin the valid range, increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step3] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step4] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta_b will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b will decrease the phase margin. On the other hand, increasing beta_b will increase the phase margin. \n[Step5] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10. A reasonable initial choice of beta_l is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nBuilding on the previous designs, follow these instructions to adjust omega_L, beta_b and beta_l.\n(i)If the previous design is unstable try increasing beta_l and omega_L.\n(ii)If in the previous designs both the phase margin and settling time are smaller than the design requirements, try to increase beta_b and beta_l as much as possible.\n(iii)If in the previous designs the phase margin is smaller than the design requirement and the settling time is greater than the maximum allowable settling time, then increase omega_L, decrease beta_b and beta_l.\n(iv)If in the previous designs the phase margin satisfies the design requirement and the settling time is smaller than the minimum allowable value, increase beta_b and beta_l and, if necessary, decrease omega_L slightly.\n(v)If in the previous designs the phase margin satisfies the design requirement and the settling time is greater than the maximum allowable value, decrease beta_b and, if necessary, increase omega_L.\nNote: Keep in mind that if adjusting omega_L, beta_b and beta_l improves the design but doesn't fully meet the requirements, double the adjustment step size after each improvement to reach the target faster.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l.

Additionally, since the settling time is within the acceptable range, we can afford to slightly increase omega_L to further enhance the phase margin without compromising the settling time.
