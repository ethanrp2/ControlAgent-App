Let's denote this pole as p.\n[Step2] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L greater than (5*p) for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Systems with unstable pole(s) puts a hard limit on the achievable bandwidth, you should never choose a loop bandwidth less than (5*p).\nWithin the valid range, increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step3] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step4] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies.

A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta_b will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b will decrease the phase margin. On the other hand, increasing beta_b will increase the phase margin. \n[Step5] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.
