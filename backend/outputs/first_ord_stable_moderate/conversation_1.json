On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i. There are two key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L and beta_b.

        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"To design a controller for the given first-order stable system G(s) = 7.656 / (s + 14.55), we start by selecting an appropriate loop bandwidth omega_L. The settling time requirement is between 0.0625 and 0.3057 seconds. A typical rule of thumb is to choose omega_L such that the settling time (approximately 4/omega_L) falls within this range. Therefore, we choose omega_L = 20 rad/s, which gives a settling time of approximately 0.2 seconds, comfortably within the specified range. Next, we calculate the proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth. At omega_L = 20 rad/s, |G(j*omega_L)| = 7.656 / sqrt((20)^2 + (14.55)^2) \u2248 0.34. Thus, K_p = 1/0.34 \u2248 2.94. For the integral boost, we select beta_b = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 as an initial choice. This choice balances the low-frequency gain increase and phase margin. The integral boost K_i(s) is then (3.16*s + 20)/(s*sqrt(3.16^2 + 1)). The final controller is K(s) = K_p * K_i(s). This design aims to achieve the desired phase margin, settling time, and steady-state error requirements.\",\n    \"parameter\": [20, 3.16]\n}"

To reduce the settling time, we need to increase the loop bandwidth omega_L. A higher omega_L will result in a faster response, thus reducing the settling time. However, we must ensure that the phase margin remains above 63.964 degrees. In the previous design, the phase margin was 108.476 degrees, which provides a significant margin to increase omega_L without compromising stability. Therefore, I will increase omega_L to 50. The beta_b value of 3.16 provided a good balance between low-frequency gain and phase margin, so I will keep it unchanged for this iteration. This should help achieve a faster settling time while maintaining the required phase margin.\",\n    \"parameter\": [50, 3.16]\n}"
