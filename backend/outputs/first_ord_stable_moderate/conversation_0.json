On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i. There are two key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L and beta_b.

The controller must achieve a phase margin of at least 71.542 degrees, a settling time between 2.386 and 14.765 seconds, and a steady-state error of no more than 0.0001.\n\n## Response Instruction\nPlease provide the controller design to the given plant G(s).

The 'design' key can contain design steps and rationale about the parameters choice or the reason to update specific parameter based on the previous design and performance, and the 'parameter' key should ONLY provide a list of numerical values of the chosen parameters [omega_L, beta_b].\n\nExample of expected JSON response format:\n\n{\n    \"design\": \"[Detailed design steps and rationale behind parameters choice]\",\n    \"parameter\": [List of Parameters]\n}\n\n",
        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"To design a controller for the given first-order stable system G(s) = 19.95 / (s + 0.3897), we start by selecting an appropriate loop bandwidth omega_L. The settling time requirement is between 2.386 and 14.765 seconds. A typical rule of thumb is that the settling time Ts is approximately 4/omega_L. To meet the settling time requirement, we choose omega_L = 1.5 rad/s, which gives a settling time of approximately 2.67 seconds, within the desired range. Next, we calculate the proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth. At omega_L = 1.5 rad/s, |G(j*1.5)| = 19.95 / sqrt((1.5)^2 + 0.3897^2) \u2248 13.3. Therefore, K_p = 1/13.3 \u2248 0.075. For the integral boost, we select beta_b = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 as an initial choice. This choice balances the low-frequency gain increase and phase margin. The integral boost K_i(s) is then (3.16*s + 1.5)/(s*sqrt(3.16^2 + 1)). The final controller is K(s) = K_p * K_i(s). This design aims to achieve the required phase margin, settling time, and steady-state error.\",\n    \"parameter\": [1.5, 3.16]\n}"

To increase the settling time to be within the desired range, we need to decrease omega_L. This will slow down the system response, increasing the settling time. Additionally, the phase margin was already above the required 71.542 degrees, so we have some room to adjust omega_L without compromising the phase margin requirement. Therefore, I will decrease omega_L from 1.5 to 1.0. The beta_b value of 3.16 provided a good phase margin, so I will keep it unchanged for now to maintain robustness.
