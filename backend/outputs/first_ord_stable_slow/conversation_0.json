On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i. There are two key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L and beta_b.

        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"To design a controller for the given first-order stable system G(s) = 19.95 / (s + 0.3897), we start by selecting an appropriate loop bandwidth omega_L. The settling time requirement is between 67.16 and 182.69 seconds, which suggests a relatively low bandwidth. A reasonable initial choice for omega_L is 0.1 rad/s, which should provide a settling time within the desired range. Next, we calculate the proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth. At omega_L = 0.1 rad/s, |G(j*0.1)| = 19.95 / sqrt((0.1)^2 + 0.3897^2) \u2248 50.98. Therefore, K_p = 1 / 50.98 \u2248 0.0196. For the integral boost, we choose beta_b = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.1623, which is a reasonable starting point to balance low-frequency gain and phase margin. The integral boost K_i(s) is then (3.1623*s + 0.1) / (s*sqrt(3.1623^2 + 1)). The final controller is K(s) = K_p * K_i(s).

        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"In the first design, the loop bandwidth omega_L was set to 0.1, and beta_b was set to 3.1623. The resulting phase margin was very high at 148.06 degrees, and the settling time was 201.57 seconds, which is longer than the maximum allowed settling time of 182.69 seconds. To reduce the settling time, we need to increase the loop bandwidth omega_L. A reasonable approach is to increase omega_L to 0.15, which should decrease the settling time while still maintaining a good phase margin. The beta_b value of 3.1623 provided a high phase margin, so we will keep it the same for now to ensure robustness. This adjustment aims to bring the settling time within the desired range while maintaining the phase margin above the required 71.54 degrees.\",\n    \"parameter\": [0.15, 3.1623]\n}"
