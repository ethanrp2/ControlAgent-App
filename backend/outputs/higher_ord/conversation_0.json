The poles of the system suggest a relatively slow response due to the presence of poles with real parts at -50 and -30, and a pair of complex conjugate poles with real parts at -2.1. \\n\\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L. Given the requirement for a settling time between 0.48 and 4.13 seconds, we aim for a moderate bandwidth. A reasonable starting point is omega_L = 10 rad/s, which should provide a balance between speed and stability. \\n\\n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p. Calculate |G(j*omega_L)| at omega_L = 10 rad/s. After evaluating the magnitude of G(s) at this frequency, we find |G(j*10)| \u2248 0.1125. Therefore, K_p = 1/|G(j*10)| \u2248 8.89. \\n\\n[Step3] Design an integral boost.

The integral boost K_i(s) = (beta_b * s + omega_L) / (s * sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) will help improve tracking and disturbance rejection. \\n\\n[Step4] Design a lead control.

Increase beta_l to 150 to significantly boost the phase margin, as previous designs with lower beta_l values did not achieve the required phase margin. 3. Keep beta_b at 3.16 to maintain a balance between low-frequency gain and phase margin. This combination should help achieve the desired phase margin and settling time while maintaining stability.\",\n    \"parameter\": [4, 3.16, 150]\n}"

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a fourth-order system with a transfer function of 1125 / (s^4 + 84.2s^3 + 1845s^2 + 7020s + 13500).

A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any.

The designs with lower omega_L, such as Design 13, achieved a high phase margin but failed to meet the settling time requirement. To address these issues, we need to find a balance between omega_L and beta_l to achieve the desired phase margin and settling time. Since the phase margin is significantly below the requirement, we should increase beta_l to improve the phase margin. However, we must be cautious with omega_L to avoid instability. Let's try a moderate omega_L of 3.5, which previously led to instability, but this time with a higher beta_l to improve stability and phase margin.

Since a lower omega_L tends to stabilize the system, we will try a slightly lower omega_L than in Design 20 to reduce the settling time. We will also adjust beta_l to increase the phase margin while keeping beta_b constant to maintain low-frequency performance. Therefore, we will set omega_L to 3.2, beta_b to 3.16, and beta_l to 12.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a fourth-order system with a transfer function of 1125 / (s^4 + 84.2s^3 + 1845s^2 + 7020s + 13500).

The most recent designs have shown that a phase margin close to the requirement was achieved with omega_L around 3.3 to 3.4, but the phase margin was still slightly below the target. To improve the phase margin, we need to increase beta_l slightly. However, we must be cautious not to increase it too much, as it could negatively impact the settling time. Therefore, I will increase beta_l to 14.5, which should help us achieve the desired phase margin while keeping the settling time within the acceptable range.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a fourth-order system with a transfer function of 1125 / (s^4 + 84.2s^3 + 1845s^2 + 7020s + 13500).

The last design (Design 28) had a phase margin of 53.26 degrees, which is close to the target but still insufficient. The settling time was within the acceptable range. To improve the phase margin, we need to increase beta_l, which directly affects the phase margin. However, we must be cautious not to degrade the settling time too much. Given the previous results, I will increase beta_l to 16, which should help us achieve the desired phase margin. I will keep omega_L at 3.35 to maintain the settling time within the required range and beta_b at 3.16 to ensure stability and performance at low frequencies.\",\n    \"parameter\": [3.35, 3.16, 16]\n}"

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a fourth-order system with a transfer function of 1125 / (s^4 + 84.2s^3 + 1845s^2 + 7020s + 13500). The controller must ensure a phase margin of at least 55.54 degrees, a settling time between 0.48 and 4.13 seconds, and a steady-state error of no more than 0.0001.

        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"In the previous designs, we have been struggling to achieve the required phase margin of at least 55.54 degrees while keeping the settling time within the specified range. The last few designs have been close in terms of settling time but have not met the phase margin requirement. To address this, we need to focus on increasing the phase margin without significantly affecting the settling time. The phase margin can be increased by adjusting beta_l. In Design 29, the phase margin was 53.26 degrees with beta_l set to 16. To increase the phase margin, we will increase beta_l to 18. This should help us achieve the desired phase margin while keeping the settling time within the acceptable range. We will keep omega_L at 3.35 and beta_b at 3.16 as these values have been providing a reasonable settling time.\",\n    \"parameter\": [3.35, 3.16, 18]\n}"
