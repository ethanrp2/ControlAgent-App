We will also reduce beta_b to 2.0 to increase the low-frequency gain, which should help with disturbance rejection and tracking. Finally, we will set beta_l to 15, which is a moderate increase from previous designs, to improve the phase margin without excessively degrading the tracking performance.\",\n    \"parameter\": [12, 2.0, 15]\n}"

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a third-order system with the transfer function 225 / (s^3 + 54.2s^2 + 219s + 450).

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l.

On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase.

Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a third-order system with the transfer function 225 / (s^3 + 54.2s^2 + 219s + 450).

The phase margin has been consistently below the required 56.542 degrees, and many designs have resulted in instability. To address these issues, we need to carefully adjust our parameters. First, let's focus on achieving a stable design with a reasonable phase margin. We will start by selecting a moderate omega_L to ensure a balance between speed and stability. Given the previous results, an omega_L of 4.5 was close to achieving a stable design. However, the phase margin was still negative. We will slightly increase omega_L to 5 to see if we can improve the phase margin while maintaining stability. Next, we will choose a beta_b of 0.5, which has shown potential for stability in previous designs. Finally, we will select a beta_l of 400, as increasing beta_l generally increases the phase margin. This combination aims to achieve a stable design with a phase margin closer to the requirement.\",\n    \"parameter\": [5, 0.5, 400]\n}"

The phase margin has been consistently below the required 56.542 degrees, and many designs have resulted in instability. To address these issues, we need to carefully adjust our parameters. First, let's focus on achieving a stable system with a reasonable phase margin. We will start by selecting a moderate omega_L to ensure the system is not too aggressive, which has led to instability in previous designs. Let's choose omega_L = 4, which is a conservative choice based on previous designs. Next, we will select beta_b = 0.8, which provides a balance between low-frequency gain and phase margin. Finally, we will choose beta_l = 10, which is a lower value compared to previous designs with high beta_l values that resulted in low phase margins. This should help us achieve a better phase margin while maintaining stability. This combination should provide a more stable design with a better chance of meeting the phase margin requirement.\",\n    \"parameter\": [4, 0.8, 10]\n}"

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a third-order system with the transfer function 225 / (s^3 + 54.2s^2 + 219s + 450).

Your response should strictly adhere to the following JSON format, which includes two keys: 'design' and 'parameter'. The 'design' key can contain design steps and rationale about the parameters choice or the reason to update specific parameter based on the previous design and performance, and the 'parameter' key should ONLY provide a list of numerical values of the chosen parameters [omega_L, beta_b, beta_l].\n\nExample of expected JSON response format:\n\n{\n    \"design\": \"[Detailed design steps and rationale behind parameters choice]\",\n    \"parameter\": [List of Parameters]\n}\n\n",
        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"In the previous designs, we have struggled to achieve the required phase margin and settling time. The phase margin has been consistently below the required 56.542 degrees, and the settling time has often been too long. To address these issues, we need to make more aggressive adjustments. First, we will decrease omega_L to 3.5 to reduce the settling time while maintaining stability. Next, we will increase beta_b to 0.9 to improve low-frequency gain, which should help with tracking and disturbance rejection. Finally, we will set beta_l to 5, a more moderate value, to increase the phase margin without excessively degrading tracking performance. This combination aims to balance the phase margin and settling time requirements.\",\n    \"parameter\": [3.5, 0.9, 5]\n}"
