        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1.

Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l.

The controller must ensure a phase margin of at least 61.568 degrees, a settling time between 2.050 and 12.397 seconds, and a steady-state error of no more than 0.0001.\n\n## Response Instruction\nPlease provide the controller design to the given plant G(s).

The 'design' key can contain design steps and rationale about the parameters choice or the reason to update specific parameter based on the previous design and performance, and the 'parameter' key should ONLY provide a list of numerical values of the chosen parameters [omega_L, beta_b, beta_l].\n\nExample of expected JSON response format:\n\n{\n    \"design\": \"[Detailed design steps and rationale behind parameters choice]\",\n    \"parameter\": [List of Parameters]\n}\n\n",

Given the settling time requirement between 2.050 and 12.397 seconds, we aim for a moderate response speed. A reasonable starting point for omega_L is around 1 rad/s, which should provide a balance between speed and stability.\\n\\nStep 2: Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L. Calculate |G(j omega_L)| at omega_L = 1 rad/s. The magnitude of G(j omega_L) is approximately 5.883 / sqrt((1^2 - 0.9099)^2 + (1.427*1)^2) = 5.883 / sqrt(0.0901 + 2.0369) = 5.883 / sqrt(2.127) \u2248 4.05.

To reduce the settling time, we need to increase the loop bandwidth omega_L. This will make the system response faster. Therefore, I will increase omega_L from 1 to 2. This should help in reducing the settling time significantly. The phase margin in Design 1 was very high at 128.664 degrees, which indicates that we have room to reduce the phase margin to meet the requirement of at least 61.568 degrees. Thus, I will keep beta_l at 5 for now, as it provides a good balance between phase margin and performance. The beta_b value of 3.16 was initially chosen to provide a reasonable integral boost.
