        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b s  + omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta_b \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \n[Step4] Design a lead control, select K_l (s) = (beta_l*s+ omega_L)/(s+ beta_l*omega_L) with beta_l >= 1. Typical values of beta_l are in the range of 2 to 10.\nNote: Increase beta_l will increase the phase margin, but this will degrade the tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection. Hence it is desirable to choose suitable beta_l to just achieve desired phase margins.\n\nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i * K_l. There are three key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L, beta_b, and beta_l. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nTo summarize: to achieve faster (slower) response, increase (decrease) omega_L, to achieve higher (lower) phase margin, increase (decrease) beta_l.\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a second-order system with the transfer function 14.98 / (s^2 + 3.392s + 5.186). The controller must ensure a phase margin of at least 54.76 degrees, a settling time between 0.71 and 6.34 seconds, and a steady-state error of no more than 0.0001.\n\n## Response Instruction\nPlease provide the controller design to the given plant G(s). Your response should strictly adhere to the following JSON format, which includes two keys: 'design' and 'parameter'. The 'design' key can contain design steps and rationale about the parameters choice or the reason to update specific parameter based on the previous design and performance, and the 'parameter' key should ONLY provide a list of numerical values of the chosen parameters [omega_L, beta_b, beta_l].\n\nExample of expected JSON response format:\n\n{\n    \"design\": \"[Detailed design steps and rationale behind parameters choice]\",\n    \"parameter\": [List of Parameters]\n}\n\n",
        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"To design a controller for the given second-order system G(s) = 14.98 / (s^2 + 3.392s + 5.186), we will follow the loop shaping method. First, we need to choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L. Given the settling time requirement between 0.71 and 6.34 seconds, we can start with an initial omega_L that corresponds to a moderate response speed. Let's choose omega_L = 2 rad/s as a starting point. This choice is a balance between achieving a faster response and maintaining robustness. Next, we calculate the proportional gain K_p. At omega_L = 2 rad/s, we evaluate |G(j*omega_L)|. Substituting s = j*2 into G(s), we find |G(j*2)| \u2248 2. Therefore, K_p = 1/|G(j*2)| \u2248 0.5. For the integral boost, we select beta_b = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 to improve low-frequency performance while maintaining robustness. The integral boost is K_i(s) = (3.16s + 2)/(s*sqrt(3.16^2 + 1)). Finally, we design the lead control with beta_l = 5 to achieve the desired phase margin. The lead control is K_l(s) = (5s + 2)/(s + 10). The final controller is K(s) = K_p * K_i(s) * K_l(s). This design aims to meet the phase margin requirement of at least 54.76 degrees, the settling time requirement, and the steady-state error requirement.\",\n    \"parameter\": [2, 3.16, 5]\n}"

To reduce the settling time, we need to increase the loop bandwidth omega_L. This will make the system response faster. Therefore, I will increase omega_L from 2 to 4. The phase margin in the first design was very high at 122.86 degrees, which suggests that we have room to decrease beta_l to reduce the phase margin closer to the desired 54.76 degrees. I will decrease beta_l from 5 to 3. This should help in achieving a more balanced design with a faster response while maintaining adequate phase margin.
