        "Problem Statement": "\n\nYou are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.\nThe loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:\n[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). \nNote: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  \n[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \\pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta \\ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \\sqrt(10). \nNote: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. \nThus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i. There are two key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L and beta_b. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these two parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.\n\nYou will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  \nNote: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.\n\nNow consider the following design task:Design a controller for a first-order stable system with transfer function 7.656 / (s + 14.55). The controller must achieve a phase margin of at least 63.964 degrees, a settling time between 0.000188 and 0.066361 seconds, and a steady-state error of no more than 0.0001.\n\n## Response Instruction\nPlease provide the controller design to the given plant G(s). Your response should strictly adhere to the following JSON format, which includes two keys: 'design' and 'parameter'. The 'design' key can contain design steps and rationale about the parameters choice or the reason to update specific parameter based on the previous design and performance, and the 'parameter' key should ONLY provide a list of numerical values of the chosen parameters [omega_L, beta_b].\n\nExample of expected JSON response format:\n\n{\n    \"design\": \"[Detailed design steps and rationale behind parameters choice]\",\n    \"parameter\": [List of Parameters]\n}\n\n",
        "Response": "{\n    \"design\": \"To design a controller for the given first-order stable system G(s) = 7.656 / (s + 14.55), we start by selecting an appropriate loop bandwidth omega_L. Given the settling time requirement between 0.000188 and 0.066361 seconds, we aim for a faster response, so we choose an initial omega_L of 100 rad/s, which is a reasonable starting point for achieving a fast response. Next, we calculate the proportional gain K_p using the formula K_p = 1 / |G(j*omega_L)|. Substituting omega_L = 100 into G(s), we find |G(j*100)| = 7.656 / sqrt((100)^2 + (14.55)^2) = 0.0758. Thus, K_p = 1 / 0.0758 \u2248 13.2. For the integral boost, we select beta_b = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 as an initial choice to balance between low-frequency gain improvement and phase margin. The integral boost K_i(s) is then defined as (beta_b*s + omega_L) / (s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)). The final controller K(s) is K_p * K_i(s). This initial design aims to meet the phase margin requirement of at least 63.964 degrees and the settling time constraint. If the performance does not meet the requirements, we will adjust omega_L and beta_b accordingly.\",\n    \"parameter\": [100, 3.16]\n}"
